# Analyze COVID-19- Data using python notebook within Microsoft Azure Machine Learning.
At the present time we face a unique challenge with the (COVID-19), (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. With no vaccine or cure, populations have been instructed to physically separate from each other in an attempt to stem the tide of infection, prompting massive social distancing measures and lockdowns that have sparked fear and uncertainty.

At the time, hospitals and healthcare facilities implemented strict infection control measures with increased intensity. So Microsoft need to develop a new way to give their customer a needed forecasting and reporting about this epidemic until we pass this situation safely. Here we can easily recognize how science, AI / Analytics can assist to remediate and minimize the risk.

# Use Cases
In this lab, we will be devloping two use cases with multiple parameters. The first use case will develop is to see the capacity for COVID-19 testing around the globe inlcuding 1) Seld-Quarantined 2) Healthcare Services-Priority

# Data
I will be using data from [Our world in Data which has the testing data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing) and [COVID-19 Data from John Hopkins](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)

# Prerequisite
For this experiment, I will be using Azure Machine Leanring services. The instruction to provision can be found [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/videos/provisioning-ml-workspaces-from-portal/)
